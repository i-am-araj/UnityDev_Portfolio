# 👋 Hi, I'm Anurag Raj – Unity Game Developer

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented game developer with 4 years of hands-on experience building immersive games using Unity and C#. I specialize in **game physics**, **AI systems**, and creating gameplay experiences that feel responsive, dynamic, and fun.

Over the years, I’ve built and shipped multiple 2D and 3D games across PC, Android, and WebGL platforms, focusing on:
- Realistic and arcade-style **physics-based mechanics**
- Intelligent and adaptable **enemy AI** using behavior trees, state machines, and pathfinding
- Performance-optimized codebases and scalable game architectures
